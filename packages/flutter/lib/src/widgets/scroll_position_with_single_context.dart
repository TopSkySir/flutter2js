/// A scroll position that manages scroll activities for a single

///
/// This class is a concrete subclass of [ScrollPosition] logic that handles a
/// single [ScrollContext], such as a [Scrollable]. An instance of this class
/// manages [ScrollActivity] instances, which change what content is visible in
/// the [Scrollable]'s [Viewport].
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ScrollPosition], which defines the underlying model for a position
///    within a [Scrollable] but is agnositic as to how that position is
///    changed.
///  * [ScrollView] and its subclasses such as [ListView], which use
///    [ScrollPositionWithSingleContext] to manage their scroll position.
///  * [ScrollController], which can manipulate one or more [ScrollPosition]s,
///    and which uses [ScrollPositionWithSingleContext] as its default class for
///    scroll positions.
