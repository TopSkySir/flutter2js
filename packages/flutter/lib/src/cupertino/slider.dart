/// An iOS-style slider.
///
/// Used to select from a range of values.
///
/// A slider can be used to select from either a continuous or a discrete set of
/// values. The default is use a continuous range of values from [min] to [max].
/// To use discrete values, use a non-null value for [divisions], which
/// indicates the number of discrete intervals. For example, if [min] is 0.0 and
/// [max] is 50.0 and [divisions] is 5, then the slider can take on the values
/// discrete values 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, and 50.0.
///
/// The slider itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the state of
/// the slider changes, the widget calls the [onChanged] callback. Most widgets
/// that use a slider will listen for the [onChanged] callback and rebuild the
/// slider with a new [value] to update the visual appearance of the slider.
