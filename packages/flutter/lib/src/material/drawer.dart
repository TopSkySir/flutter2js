// Width = Screen width âˆ’ 56 dp
// Maximum width: 320dp
// Maximum width applies only when using a left nav. When using a right nav,

// Desktop/Tablet:
// Maximum width for a left nav is 400dp.
// The right nav can vary depending on content.

/// A material design panel that slides in horizontally from the edge of a
/// [Scaffold] to show navigation links in an application.
///
/// Drawers are typically used with the [Scaffold.drawer] property. The child of
/// the drawer is usually a [ListView] whose first child is a [DrawerHeader]
/// that displays status information about the current user. The remaining
/// drawer children are often constructed with [ListTile]s, often concluding
/// with an [AboutListTile].
///
/// An open drawer can be closed by calling [Navigator.pop]. For example
/// a drawer item might close the drawer when tapped:
///
/// ```dart
/// new ListTile(
///   leading: new Icon(Icons.change_history),
///   title: new Text('Change history'),
///   onTap: () {
///     // change app state...
///     Navigator.pop(context); // close the drawer
///   },
/// );
/// ```
///
/// The [AppBar] automatically displays an appropriate [IconButton] to show the
/// [Drawer] when a [Drawer] is available in the [Scaffold]. The [Scaffold]
/// automatically handles the edge-swipe gesture to show the drawer.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Scaffold.drawer], where one specifies a [Drawer] so that it can be
///    shown.
///  * [Scaffold.of], to obtain the current [ScaffoldState], which manages the
///    display and animation of the drawer.
///  * [ScaffoldState.openDrawer], which displays its [Drawer], if any.
