///
/// This class is used by [BoxDecoration] to represent gradients. This abstracts
/// out the arguments to the [new ui.Gradient.linear] constructor from the
/// `dart:ui` library.
///
/// A gradient has two anchor points, [begin] and [end]. The [begin] point
/// corresponds to 0.0, and the [end] point corresponds to 1.0. These points are
/// expressed in fractions, so that the same gradient can be reused with varying
/// sized boxes without changing the parameters. (This contrasts with [new
/// ui.Gradient.linear], whose arguments are expressed in logical pixels.)
///
/// The [colors] are described by a list of [Color] objects. There must be at
/// least two colors. If there are more than two, a [stops] list must be
/// provided. It must have the same length as [colors], and specifies the
/// position of each color stop between 0.0 and 1.0.
///
/// The region of the canvas before [begin] and after [end] is colored according
/// to [tileMode].
///
/// Typically this class is used with [BoxDecoration], which does the painting.
/// To use a [LinearGradient] to paint on a canvas directly, see [createShader].
///
/// ## Sample code
///
/// This sample draws a picture that looks like vertical window shades by having
/// a [Container] display a [BoxDecoration] with a [LinearGradient].
///
/// ```dart
/// new Container(
///   decoration: new BoxDecoration(
///     gradient: new LinearGradient(
///       begin: Alignment.topLeft,
///       end: new Alignment(0.8, 0.0), // 10% of the width, so there are ten blinds.
///       colors: [const Color(0xFFFFFFEE), const Color(0xFF999999)], // whitish to gray
///       tileMode: TileMode.repeated, // repeats the gradient over the canvas
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```

///
///  * [RadialGradient], which displays a gradient in concentric circles, and
///    has an example which shows a different way to use [Gradient] objects.
///  * [BoxDecoration], which can take a [LinearGradient] in its
///    [BoxDecoration.gradient] property.
